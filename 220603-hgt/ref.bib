  abstract = {Deep learning takes on protein folding                            In 1972, Anfinsen won a Nobel prize for demonstrating a connection between a protein’s amino acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure. Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind’s Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek               et al               . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. —VV                        ,              Protein structure modeling enables the rapid solution of protein structures and provides insights into function.           ,              DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

The increased yield of TCR specificity identification methods and the overall increase in the number of studies in the field has allowed us to expand the database more than 5-fold. Furthermore, several new analysis methods are included. For example, batch annotation of TCR repertoire sequencing samples allows for annotating large datasets on-line. Using recently developed bioinformatic methods for TCR motif mining, we have built a reduced set of high-quality TCR motifs that can be used for both training TCR specificity predictors and matching against TCRs of interest.

This work starts from the convolutional neural networks introduced in our previous paper (PhysRevD.103.102003) that searched for three classes of early inspirals in simulated Gaussian noise colored with the design-sensitivity power-spectral density of LIGO. Our new network is able to search for any type of binary neutron stars, it can take into account all the detectors available, and it can see the events even earlier than the previous one. We study the performance of our method in three different types of noise: Gaussian O3 noise, real O3 noise, and predicted O4 noise. We show that our network performs almost as well in non-Gaussian noise as in Gaussian noise: our method is robust w.r.t. glitches and artifacts present in real noise. Although it would not have been able to trigger on the BNSs detected during O3 because their signal-to-noise ratio was too weak, we expect our network to find around 3 BNSs during O4 with a time before the merger between 3 and 88 s in advance.},

  abstract = {Many continuous gravitational wave searches are affected by instrumental spectral lines that could be confused with a continuous astrophysical signal. Several techniques have been developed to limit the effect of these lines by penalizing signals that appear in only a single detector. We have developed a general method, using a convolutional neural network, to reduce the impact of instrumental artifacts on searches that use the SOAP algorithm Bayley et al. [Phys. Rev. D 100, 023006 (2019)]. The method can identify features in corresponding frequency bands of each detector and classify these bands as containing a signal, an instrumental line, or noise. We tested the method against four different datasets: Gaussian noise with time gaps, data from the final run of Initial LIGO (S6) with signals added, the reference S6 mock data challenge dataset Walsh et al. [Phys. Rev. D 94, 124010 (2016)] and signals injected into data from the second advanced LIGO observing run (O2). Using the S6 mock data challenge dataset and at a 1\% false alarm probability we showed that at 95\% efficiency a fully automated SOAP search has a sensitivity corresponding to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio of 110, equivalent to a sensitivity depth of 10 Hz−1/2, making this automated search competitive with other searches requiring significantly more computing resources and human intervention.},

A high-performance sparse tensor-vector product (SpTV), one of the most fundamental operations of processing sparse tensors, is necessary for improving efficiency of related applications. In this article, we propose aeSpTV, an adaptive and efficient SpTV framework on Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer, to solve several challenges of optimizing SpTVon high-performance computing platforms. First, to map SpTV to Sunway architecture and tame expensive memory access latency and parallel writing conflict due to the intrinsic irregularity of SpTV, we introduce an adaptive SpTV parallelization. Second, to co-execute with the parallelization design while still ensuring high efficiency, we design a sparse tensor data structure named CSSoCR. Third, based on the adaptive SpTV parallelization with the novel tensor data structure, we present an autotuner that chooses the most befitting tensor partitioning method for aeSpTV using the variance analysis theory of mathematical statistics to achieve load balance. Fourth, to further leverage the computing power of Sunway, we propose customized optimizations for aeSpTV. Experimental results show that aeSpTV yields good sacalability on both thread-level and process-level parallelism of Sunway. It achieves a maximum GFLOPS of 195.69 on 128 processes. Additionally, it is proved that optimization effects of the partitioning autotuner and optimization techniques are remarkable.},

However, the training process of CNNs is very time-consuming, where large amounts of training samples and iterative operations are required to obtain high-quality weight parameters. In this paper, we focus on the time-consuming training process of large-scale CNNs and propose a Bi-layered Parallel Training (BPT-CNN) architecture in distributed computing environments. BPT-CNN consists of two main components: (a) an outer-layer parallel training for multiple CNN subnetworks on separate data subsets, and (b) an inner-layer parallel training for each subnetwork. In the outer-layer parallelism, we address critical issues of distributed and parallel computing, including data communication, synchronization, and workload balance. A heterogeneous-aware Incremental Data Partitioning and Allocation (IDPA) strategy is proposed, where large-scale training datasets are partitioned and allocated to the computing nodes in batches according to their computing power. To minimize the synchronization waiting during the global weight update process, an Asynchronous Global Weight Update (AGWU) strategy is proposed. In the inner-layer parallelism, we further accelerate the training process for each CNN subnetwork on each computer, where computation steps of convolutional layer and the local weight training are parallelized based on task-parallelism. We introduce task decomposition and scheduling strategies with the objectives of thread-level load balancing and minimum waiting time for critical paths. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed BPT-CNN effectively improves the training performance of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.},

  abstract = {Heterogenous information network embedding aims to embed heterogenous information networks (HINs) into low dimensional spaces, in which each vertex is represented as a low-dimensional vector, and both global and local network structures in the original space are preserved. However, most of existing heterogenous information network embedding models adopt the dot product to measure the proximity in the low dimensional space, and thus they can only preserve the first-order proximity and are insufficient to capture the global structure. Compared with homogenous information networks, there are multiple types of links (i.e., multiple relations) in HINs, and the link distribution w.r.t relations is highly skewed. To address the above challenging issues, we propose a novel heterogenous information network embedding model PME based on the metric learning to capture both first-order and second-order proximities in a unified way. To alleviate the potential geometrical inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches, we propose to build object and relation embeddings in separate object space and relation spaces rather than in a common space. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by firstly projecting vertices from object space to corresponding relation space and then calculate the proximity between projected vertices. To overcome the heavy skewness of the link distribution w.r.t relations and avoid "over-sampling'' or "under-sampling'' for each relation, we propose a novel loss-aware adaptive sampling approach for the model optimization. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale HIN dataset, and the experimental results show superiority of our proposed PME model in terms of prediction accuracy and scalability.},

  abstract = {Aiming to represent user characteristics and personal interests, the task of user profiling is playing an increasingly important role for many real-world applications, e.g., e-commerce and social networks platforms. By exploiting the data like texts and user behaviors, most existing solutions address user profiling as a classification task, where each user is formulated as an individual data instance. Nevertheless, a user’s profile is not only reflected from her/his affiliated data, but also can be inferred from other users, e.g., the users that have similar copurchase behaviors in e-commerce, the friends in social networks, etc. In this paper, we approach user profiling in a semi-supervised manner, developing a generic solution based on heterogeneous graph learning. On the graph, nodes represent the entities of interest (e.g., users, items, attributes of items, etc.), and edges represent the interactions between entities. Our heterogeneous graph attention networks (HGAT) method learns the representation for each entity by accounting for the graph structure, and exploits the attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of each neighbor entity. Through such a learning scheme, HGAT can leverage both unsupervised information and limited labels of users to build the predictor. Extensive experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset verify the effectiveness and rationality of our HGAT for user profiling.},

  abstract = {A diverse T~cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is essential for controlling viral infections. However, information about TCR repertoires to defined viral antigens is limited. We performed a comprehensive analysis of~CD8+ TCR repertoires for two dominant viral epitopes: pp65495-503 (NLV) of cytomegalovirus and M158-66 (GIL) of influenza A virus. The highly individualized repertoires (87-5,533 α or β clonotypes per subject) comprised thousands of unique TCRα and TCRβ sequences and dozens of distinct complementary determining region (CDR)3α and CDR3β motifs. However, diversity is effectively restricted by preferential V-J combinations, CDR3 lengths, and CDR3α/CDR3β pairings. Structures of two GIL-specific TCRs bound to GIL-HLA-A2 provided a potential explanation for the lower diversity of GIL-specific versus NLV-specific repertoires. These anti-viral TCRs occupied up to 3.4\% of the CD8+ TCRβ repertoire, ensuring broad T~cell responses to single epitopes. Our portrait of two anti-viral TCR repertoires may inform the development of predictors of immune protection.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the "semantic" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves.},

  abstract = {Blip glitches, a type of short-duration noise transient in the LIGO--Virgo data, are a nuisance for the binary black hole (BBH) searches. They affect the BBH search sensitivity significantly because their time-domain morphologies are very similar, and that creates difficulty in vetoing them. In this work, we construct a deep-learning neural network to efficiently distinguish BBH signals from blip glitches. We introduce sine-Gaussian projection (SGP) maps, which are projections of GW frequency-domain data snippets on a basis of sine-Gaussians defined by the quality factor and central frequency. We feed the SGP maps to our deep-learning neural network, which classifies the BBH signals and blips. Whereas the BBH signals are simulated, the blips used are taken from real data throughout our analysis. We show that our network significantly improves the identification of the BBH signals in comparison to the results obtained using traditional-\$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ and sine-Gaussian \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$. For example, our network improves the sensitivity by 75\% at a false-positive rate of \$10\^\{-2\}\$ for BBHs with total mass in the range \$[80,140]\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and SNR in the range \$[3,8]\$. Also, it correctly identifies 95\% of the real GW events in GWTC-3. The computation time for classification is a few minutes for thousands of SGP maps on a single core. With further optimisation in the next version of our algorithm, we expect a further reduction in the computational cost. Our proposed method can potentially improve the veto process in the LIGO--Virgo GW data analysis and conceivably support identifying GW signals in low-latency pipelines.},

We pursue an alternative approach, in which waveforms are first represented as weighted sums over reduced bases (reduced-order modeling); we then train artificial neural networks to map gravitational-wave source parameters into basis coefficients. Statistical inference proceeds directly in coefficient space, where it is theoretically straightforward and computationally efficient. The neural networks also provide analytic waveform derivatives, which are useful for gradient-based sampling schemes. We demonstrate fast and accurate coefficient interpolation for the case of a four-dimensional binary-inspiral waveform family and discuss promising applications of our framework in parameter estimation.},

TCR ligands compose a presentation platform (major histocompatibility complex (MHC)) and a variable antigenic component consisting of a short “foreign” peptide. The sequence of events when the TCR engages its peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligand remains unclear. Some studies suggest that the germ line elements of the TCR engage the MHC prior to peptide scanning, but this order of binding is difficult to reconcile with some TCR-pMHC structures. Here, we used TCRs that exhibited enhanced pMHC binding as a result of mutations in either CDR2 and/or CDR3 loops, that bound to the MHC or peptide, respectively, to dissect the roles of these loops in stabilizing TCR-pMHC interactions. Our data show that TCR-peptide interactions play a strongly dominant energetic role providing a binding mode that is both temporally and energetically complementary with a system requiring positive selection by self-pMHC in the thymus and rapid recognition of non-self-pMHC in the periphery.},

An overwhelming amount of data from animal models—together with compelling data from human patients—indicate that a functional cancer immunosurveillance process indeed exists that acts as an extrinsic tumor suppressor. However, it has also become clear that the immune system can facilitate tumor progression, at least in part, by sculpting the immunogenic phenotype of tumors as they develop. The recognition that immunity plays a dual role in the complex interactions between tumors and the host prompted a refinement of the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis into one termed “cancer immunoediting.” In this review, we summarize the history of the cancer immunosurveillance controversy and discuss its resolution and evolution into the three Es of cancer immunoediting—elimination, equilibrium, and escape.},

The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches.

Experiments reveal that our multi-layer combination of many models offers better use of allocated training time than seeking out the best. A second contribution is an extensive evaluation of public and commercial AutoML platforms including TPOT, H2O, AutoWEKA, auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and Google AutoML Tables. Tests on a suite of 50 classification and regression tasks from Kaggle and the OpenML AutoML Benchmark reveal that AutoGluon is faster, more robust, and much more accurate.

  abstract = {With the prevalence of mobile e-commerce nowadays, a new type of recommendation services, called intent recommendation, is widely used in many mobile e-commerce Apps, such as Taobao and Amazon. Different from traditional query recommendation and item recommendation, intent recommendation is to automatically recommend user intent according to user historical behaviors without any input when users open the App. Intent recommendation becomes very popular in the past two years, because of revealing user latent intents and avoiding tedious input in mobile phones. Existing methods used in industry usually need laboring feature engineering. Moreover, they only utilize attribute and statistic information of users and queries, and fail to take full advantage of rich interaction information in intent recommendation, which may result in limited performances. In this paper, we propose to model the complex objects and rich interactions in intent recommendation as a Heterogeneous Information Network. Furthermore, we present a novel M etapath-guided E mbedding method for I ntent Rec ommendation\textasciitilde (called MEIRec). In order to fully utilize rich structural information, we design a metapath-guided heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to learn the embeddings of objects in intent recommendation. In addition, in order to alleviate huge learning parameters in embeddings, we propose a uniform term embedding mechanism, in which embeddings of objects are made up with the same term embedding space. Offline experiments on real large-scale data show the superior performance of the proposed MEIRec, compared to representative methods.Moreover, the results of online experiments on Taobao e-commerce platform show that MEIRec not only gains a performance improvement of 1.54\% on CTR metric, but also attracts up to 2.66\% of new users to search queries.},

  abstract = {We present a novel hierarchical triplet loss (HTL) capable of automatically collecting informative training samples (triplets) via a defined hierarchical tree that encodes global context information. This allows us to cope with the main limitation of random sampling in training a conventional triplet loss, which is a central issue for deep metric learning. Our main contributions are two-fold. (i) we construct a hierarchical class-level tree where neighboring classes are merged recursively. The hierarchical structure naturally captures the intrinsic data distribution over the whole database. (ii) we formulate the problem of triplet collection by introducing a new violate margin, which is computed dynamically based on the designed hierarchical tree. This allows it to automatically select meaningful hard samples with the guide of global context. It encourages the model to learn more discriminative features from visual similar classes, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Our method is evaluated on the tasks of image retrieval and face recognition, where it outperforms the standard triplet loss substantially by 1\%-18\%. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmarks, with much fewer learning iterations.},

We used yeast-display libraries of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) to screen for antigens of "orphan" T~cell receptors (TCRs) expressed on TILs from human colorectal adenocarcinoma. Four TIL-derived TCRs exhibited strong selection for peptides presented in a highly diverse pHLA-A∗02:01 library. Three of the TIL TCRs were specific for non-mutated self-antigens, two of which were present in separate patient tumors, and shared specificity for a non-mutated self-antigen derived from U2AF2. These results show that the exposed recognition surface of MHC-bound peptides accessible to the TCR contains sufficient structural information to enable the reconstruction of sequences of peptide targets for pathogenic TCRs of unknown specificity. This finding underscores the surprising specificity of TCRs for their cognate antigens and enables the facile indentification of tumor antigens through unbiased screening.},

  abstract = {The recent Nobel-prize-winning detections of gravitational waves from merging black holes and the subsequent detection of the collision of two neutron stars in coincidence with electromagnetic observations have inaugurated a new era of multimessenger astrophysics. To enhance the scope of this emergent field of science, we pioneered the use of deep learning with convolutional neural networks, that take time-series inputs, for rapid detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. This approach, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We demonstrate for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of real events observed by LIGO. Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched-filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time.},

However, it remains a non-trivial task to couple these sequenced TCRs to their antigenic targets. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to annotate full TCR sequence repertoires with their epitope specificities. The strategy is based on a machine learning algorithm to learn the TCR patterns common to the recognition of a specific epitope. These results are then combined with a statistical analysis to evaluate the occurrence of specific epitope-reactive TCR sequences per epitope in repertoire data. In this manner, we can directly study the capacity of full TCR repertoires to target specific epitopes of the relevant vaccines or pathogens. We demonstrate the usability of this approach on three independent datasets related to vaccine monitoring and infectious disease diagnostics by independently identifying the epitopes that are targeted by the TCR repertoire. The developed method is freely available as a web tool for academic use at tcrex.biodatamining.be.},

Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

While the original triplet loss is used widely in classification problems such as face recognition, face re-identification and fine-grained similarity, our proposed loss is well suited for rating datasets in which the ratings are continuous values. In contrast to original triplet loss where we have to sample data carefully, in out method, we can generate triplets using the whole dataset, and the optimization can still converge without frequently running into a model collapsing issue. The adaptive margins only need to be computed once before the training, which is much less expensive than generating triplets after every epoch as in the fixed margin case. Besides substantially improved training stability (the proposed model never collapsed in our experiments compared to a couple of times that the training collapsed on existing triplet loss), we achieved slightly better performance than the original triplet loss on various rating datasets and network architectures.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

This significantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing, as opposed to waiting. Furthermore, the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values.

Moreover, our studies provided evidence that public amino acid sequences are produced by multiple nucleotide sequences. Notably, there was skewed VDJ segment usage in long CDR3 sequences, the expression levels of 10 TRβV segments, 7 TRβJ segments and 2 TRβD segments were significantly different in the long CDR3 sequences compared to the short CDR3 sequences. Moreover, we identified that extensive N additions and increase of D gene usage contributing to TCR CDR3 length, and observed there was distinct usage frequency of amino acids in long CDR3 sequences compared to the short CDR3 sequences. \textbf{\emph{Conclusions: }}Some repertoire features could be observed in the public sequences, highly abundance clones, and long TCR CDR3 sequences, which might be helpful for further study of immune behavior and immune response.},

  abstract = {The increasing interest in international travel has raised the demand of retrieving point of interests (POIs) in multiple languages. This is even superior to find local venues such as restaurants and scenic spots in unfamiliar languages when traveling abroad. Multilingual POI retrieval, enabling users to find desired POIs in a demanded language using queries in numerous languages, has become an indispensable feature of today's global map applications such as Baidu Maps. This task is non-trivial because of two key challenges: (1) visiting sparsity and (2) multilingual query-POI matching. To this end, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Matching Network (HGAMN) to concurrently address both challenges. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous graph that contains two types of nodes: POI node and query node using the search logs of Baidu Maps. First, to alleviate challenge \#1, we construct edges between different POI nodes to link the low-frequency POIs with the high-frequency ones, which enables the transfer of knowledge from the latter to the former. Second, to mitigate challenge \#2, we construct edges between POI and query nodes based on the co-occurrences between queries and POIs, where queries in different languages and formulations can be aggregated for individual POIs. Moreover, we develop an attention-based network to jointly learn node representations of the heterogeneous graph and further design a cross-attention module to fuse the representations of both types of nodes for query-POI relevance scoring. In this way, the relevance ranking between multilingual queries and POIs with different popularity can be better handled. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets from Baidu Maps demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of HGAMN. In addition, HGAMN has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps, and it successfully keeps serving hundreds of millions of requests every day. Compared with the previously deployed model, HGAMN achieves significant performance improvement, which confirms that HGAMN is a practical and robust solution for large-scale real-world multilingual POI retrieval service.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling structured data. However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making it infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm—HGSampling—for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9–21 on various downstream tasks. The dataset and source code of HGT are publicly available at https://github.com/acbull/pyHGT.},

  abstract = {The graph embedding paradigm projects nodes of a graph into a vector space, which can facilitate various downstream graph analysis tasks such as node classification and clustering. To efficiently learn node embeddings from a graph, graph embedding techniques usually preserve the proximity between node pairs sampled from the graph using random walks. In the context of a heterogeneous graph, which contains nodes from different domains, classical random walks are biased towards highly visible domains where nodes are associated with a dominant number of paths. To overcome this bias, existing heterogeneous graph embedding techniques typically rely on meta-paths (i.e., fixed sequences of node types) to guide random walks. However, using these meta-paths either requires prior knowledge from domain experts for optimal meta-path selection, or requires extended computations to combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that does not involve any meta-path. Specifically, we propose JUST, a heterogeneous graph embedding technique using random walks with JUmp and STay strategies to overcome the aforementioned bias in an more efficient manner. JUST can not only gracefully balance between homogeneous and heterogeneous edges, it can also balance the node distribution over different domains (i.e., node types). By conducting a thorough empirical evaluation of our method on three heterogeneous graph datasets, we show the superiority of our proposed technique. In particular, compared to a state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding technique Hin2vec, which tries to optimally combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length, our technique yields better results in most experiments, with a dramatically reduced embedding learning time (about 3x speedup).},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks have shown superior performance in a wide range of applications providing a powerful representation of graph-structured data.  Recent works show that the representation can be further improved by auxiliary tasks. However, the auxiliary tasks for heterogeneous graphs, which contain rich semantic information with various types of nodes and edges, have less explored in the literature. In this paper, to learn graph neural networks on heterogeneous graphs we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning method using meta paths, which are composite relations of multiple edge types. Our proposed method is learning to learn a primary task by predicting meta-paths as auxiliary tasks. This can be viewed as a type of meta-learning. The proposed method can identify an effective combination of auxiliary tasks and automatically balance them to improve the primary task. Our methods can be applied to any graph neural networks in a plug-in manner without manual labeling or additional data. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of link prediction and node classification on heterogeneous graphs.},

  abstract = {B-cells can neutralize pathogenic molecules by targeting them with extreme specificity using receptors secreted or expressed on their surface (antibodies). This is achieved via molecular interactions between the paratope (i.e., the antibody residues involved in the binding) and the interacting region (epitope) of its target molecule (antigen). Discerning the rules that define this specificity would have profound implications for our understanding of humoral immunogenicity and its applications. The aim of this work is to produce improved, antibody-specific epitope predictions by exploiting features derived from the antigens and their cognate antibodies structures, and combining them using statistical and machine learning algorithms. We have identified several geometric and physicochemical features that are correlated in interacting paratopes and epitopes, used them to develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to generate putative epitopes-paratope pairs, and train a machine-learning model to score them. We show that, by including the structural and physicochemical properties of the paratope, we improve the prediction of the target of a given B-cell receptor. Moreover, we demonstrate a gain in predictive power both in terms of identifying the cognate antigen target for a given antibody and the antibody target for a given antigen, exceeding the results of other available tools.},

SABRs present an extracellular complex comprising a peptide and major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and induce intracellular signaling via a TCR-like signal after binding with a cognate TCR. We devised a strategy for antigen discovery using SABR libraries to screen thousands of antigenic epitopes.

TCRs can be sequenced from individuals and methods analyzing the specificity of the TCRs can help us better understand individuals’ immune status in different disorders. For this task, we have developed TCRGP, a novel Gaussian process method that predicts if TCRs recognize specified epitopes. TCRGP can utilize the amino acid sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from TCRα and TCRβ chains and learn which CDRs are important in recognizing different epitopes. Our comprehensive evaluation with epitope-specific TCR sequencing data shows that TCRGP achieves on average higher prediction accuracy in terms of AUROC score than existing state-of-the-art methods in epitope-specificity predictions. We also propose a novel analysis approach for combined single-cell RNA and TCRαβ (scRNA+TCRαβ) sequencing data by quantifying epitope-specific TCRs with TCRGP and identify HBV-epitope specific T cells and their transcriptomic states in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.},

Due to the massive scale of data coming from these new and upcoming sky surveys, machine learning techniques using galaxy photometry are increasingly adopted to predict galactic redshifts which are important for inferring cosmological parameters such as the nature of dark energy. Associated uncertainty estimates are also critical measurements, however, common machine learning methods typically provide only point estimates and lack uncertainty information as outputs. We turn to Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as a promising way to provide accurate predictions of redshift values. We have compiled a new galaxy training dataset from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey, designed to mimic large surveys, but over a smaller portion of the sky. We evaluate the performance and accuracy of photometric redshift (photo-z) predictions from photometry using machine learning, astronomical and probabilistic metrics. We find that while the Bayesian neural network did not perform as well as non-Bayesian neural networks if evaluated solely by point estimate photo-z values, BNNs can provide uncertainty estimates that are necessary for cosmology},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

In this work, we present an approach that combines Ad-versarial Pre-Training with Triplet Loss AdversarialFine-Tuning. We compare our methods with the pre-trained ResNet50 model that forms the backbone of FaceNet, finetuned on our CelebA dataset. Through comparing adversarial robustness achieved without adversarial training, with triplet loss adversarial training, and our contrastive pre-training combined with triplet loss adversarial fine-tuning, we find that our method achieves comparable results with far fewer epochs re-quired during fine-tuning. This seems promising, increasing the training time for fine-tuning should yield even better results. In addition to this, a modified semi-supervised experiment was conducted, which demonstrated the improvement of contrastive adversarial training with the introduction of small amounts of labels.},

  abstract = {Turbulence plays an integral role in astrophysical phenomena, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSN). Unfortunately, current simulations must resort to using subgrid models for turbulence treatment, as direct numerical simulations (DNS) are too expensive to run. However, subgrid models used in CCSN simulations lack accuracy compared to DNS results. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) has shown impressive prediction capability for turbulence closure. We have developed a physics-informed, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to preserve the realizability condition of Reynolds stress that is necessary for accurate turbulent pressure prediction. The applicability of the ML model was tested for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence subgrid modeling in both stationary and dynamic regimes. Our future goal is to utilize our ML methodology within the MHD CCSN framework to investigate the effects of accurately-modeled turbulence on the explosion rate of these events.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In this paper, we use the relationship between graph convolutional networks (GCN) and PageRank to derive an improved propagation scheme based on personalized PageRank. We utilize this propagation procedure to construct a simple model, personalized propagation of neural predictions (PPNP), and its fast approximation, APPNP. Our model's training time is on par or faster and its number of parameters on par or lower than previous models. It leverages a large, adjustable neighborhood for classification and can be easily combined with any neural network.

Deciphering the information stored in BCR sequence datasets will transform our understanding of disease and enable discovery of novel diagnostics and antibody therapeutics. A key challenge of BCR sequence analysis is the prediction of BCR properties from their amino acid sequence alone. Here, we present an antibody-specific language model, Antibody-specific Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (AntiBERTa), which provides a contextualized representation of BCR sequences. Following pre-training, we show that AntiBERTa embeddings capture biologically relevant information, generalizable to a range of applications. As a case study, we fine-tune AntiBERTa to predict paratope positions from an antibody sequence, outperforming public tools across multiple metrics. To our knowledge, AntiBERTa is the deepest protein-family-specific language model, providing a rich representation of BCRs. AntiBERTa embeddings are primed for multiple downstream tasks and can improve our understanding of the language of antibodies.},

Previous researches such as opinion detection and opinion summarization have been studied for this problem. However, these works mainly focus on the content of text without taking the quality of short text and features of social media into consideration. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph model for users’ opinion detection on microblog. We first extract keywords of topics. Then, a three-level microblog graph is constructed by combining user influence, word importance, post significance, and topic periodicity. Microblog posts are ranked from different topics by using the random walk algorithm. Experimental results on real a dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach. In comparison with baseline approaches, the proposed method achieves 8~\% improvement.},

  abstract = {Many interesting problems in machine learning are being revisited with new deep learning tools. For graph-based semisupervised learning, a recent important development is graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which nicely integrate local vertex features and graph topology in the convolutional layers. Although the GCN model compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods, its mechanisms are not clear and it still requires a considerable amount of labeled data for validation and model selection. In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the GCN model and address its fundamental limits. First, we show that the graph convolution of the GCN model is actually a special form of Laplacian smoothing, which is the key reason why GCNs work, but it also brings potential concerns of over-smoothing with many convolutional layers. Second, to overcome the limits of the GCN model with shallow architectures, we propose both co-training and self-training approaches to train GCNs. Our approaches significantly improve GCNs in learning with very few labels, and exempt them from requiring additional labels for validation. Extensive experiments on benchmarks have verified our theory and proposals.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve impressive performance in a wide variety of fields. Their success benefited from a massive boost when very deep CNN models were able to be reliably trained. Despite their merits, CNNs fail to properly address problems with non-Euclidean data. To overcome this challenge, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build graphs to represent non-Euclidean data, borrow concepts from CNNs, and apply them in training. GCNs show promising results, but they are usually limited to very shallow models due to the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, most state-of-the-art GCN models are no deeper than 3 or 4 layers. In this work, we present new ways to successfully train very deep GCNs. We do this by borrowing concepts from CNNs, specifically residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapting them to GCN architectures. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of these deep GCN frameworks. Finally, we use these new concepts to build a very deep 56-layer GCN, and show how it significantly boosts performance (+3.7\% mIoU over state-of-the-art) in the task of point cloud semantic segmentation. We believe that the community can greatly benefit from this work, as it opens up many opportunities for advancing GCN-based research.},

Graph neural networks (GNNs), as an effective graph representation technique, have shown impressive performance in learning graph embedding. However, KGs have an intrinsic property of heterogeneity, which contains various types of entities and relations. How to address complex graph data and aggregate multiple types of semantic information simultaneously is a critical issue. In this article, a novel heterogeneous GNNs framework based on attention mechanism is proposed. Specifically, the neighbor features of an entity are first aggregated under each relation-path. Then the importance of different relation-paths is learned through the relation features. Finally, each relation-path-based features with the learned weight values are aggregated to generate the embedding representation. Thus, the proposed method not only aggregates entity features from different semantic aspects but also allocates appropriate weights to them. This method can capture various types of semantic information and selectively aggregate informative features. The experiment results on three real-world KGs demonstrate superior performance when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

We compared the binding modes of three distinct human TCRs, CA5, SB27, and SB47, complexed with a "super-bulged" viral peptide (LPEPLPQGQLTAY) restricted by HLA-B*35:08. The CA5 and SB27 TCRs engaged HLA-B*35:08(LPEP) similarly, straddling the central region of the peptide but making limited contacts with HLA-B*35:08. Remarkably, the CA5 TCR did not contact the α1-helix of HLA-B*35:08. Differences in the CDR3β loop between the CA5 and SB27 TCRs caused altered fine specificities. Surprisingly, the SB47 TCR engaged HLA-B*35:08(LPEP) using a completely distinct binding mechanism, namely "bypassing" the bulged peptide and making extensive contacts with the extreme N-terminal end of HLA-B*35:08. This docking footprint included HLA-I residues not observed previously as TCR contact sites. The three TCRs exhibited differing patterns of alloreactivity toward closely related or distinct HLA-I allotypes. Thus, the human T-cell repertoire comprises a range of TCRs that can interact with "bulged" pHLA-I epitopes using unpredictable strategies, including the adoption of atypical footprints on the MHC-I.},

  abstract = {Detecting the newly emerging malware variants in real time is crucial for mitigating cyber risks and proactively blocking intrusions. In this paper, we propose MG-DVD, a novel detection framework based on dynamic heterogeneous graph learning, to detect malware variants in real time. Particularly, MG-DVD first models the fine-grained execution event streams of malware variants into dynamic heterogeneous graphs and investigates real-world meta-graphs between malware objects, which can effectively characterize more discriminative malicious evolutionary patterns between malware and their variants. Then, MG-DVD presents two dynamic walk-based heterogeneous graph learning methods to learn more comprehensive representations of malware variants, which significantly reduces the cost of the entire graph retraining. As a result, MG-DVD is equipped with the ability to detect malware variants in real time, and it presents better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-graphs. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale samples prove that our proposed MG-DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting malware variants in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD.

  abstract = {While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable results in a variety of applications, recent studies exposed important shortcomings in their ability to capture heterogeneous structures and attributes of an underlying graph. Furthermore, though many Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results, there are limited theoretical understandings of their properties. To this end, we introduce graph kernel to HGNNs and develop a Heterogeneous Graph Kernel-based Graph Neural Networks (HGK-GNN). Specifically, we incorporate the Mahalanobis distance (MD) to build a Heterogeneous Graph Kernel (HGK), and incorporating it into deep neural architectures, thus leveraging a heterogeneous GNN with a heterogeneous aggregation scheme. Also, we mathematically bridge HGK-GNN to metapath-based HGNNs, which are the most popular and effective variants of HGNNs. We theoretically analyze HGK-GNN with the indispensable Encoder and Aggregator component in metapath-based HGNNs, through which we provide a theoretical perspective to understand the most popular HGNNs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce HGK into the field of HGNNs, and mark a first step in the direction of theoretically understanding and analyzing HGNNs. Correspondingly, both graph and node classification experiments are leveraged to evaluate HGK-GNN, where HGK-GNN outperforms a wide range of baselines on six real-world datasets, endorsing the analysis.},

  abstract = {Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumour cells by T cells; however, only a small proportion of neoantigens truly elicit T-cell responses, and few clues exist as to which neoantigens are recognized by which T-cell receptors (TCRs). We built a transfer learning-based model named the pMHC–TCR binding prediction network (pMTnet) to predict TCR binding specificities of the neoantigens—and T cell antigens in general—presented by class I major histocompatibility complexes. pMTnet was comprehensively validated by a series of analyses and exhibited great advances over previous works. By applying pMTnet to human tumour genomics data, we discovered that neoantigens were generally more immunogenic than self-antigens, but human endogenous retrovirus E (a special type of self-antigen that is reactivated in kidney cancer) is more immunogenic than neoantigens. We further discovered that patients with more clonally expanded T cells that exhibit better affinity against truncal rather than subclonal neoantigens had more favourable prognosis and treatment response to immunotherapy in melanoma and lung cancer but not in kidney cancer. Predicting TCR–neoantigen/antigen pairing is one of the most daunting challenges in modern immunology; however, we achieved an accurate prediction of the pairing using only the TCR sequence (CDR3β), antigen sequence and class I major histocompatibility complex allele, and our work revealed unique insights into the interactions between TCRs and major histocompatibility complexes in human tumours, using pMTnet as a discovery tool.},

The TCR contacts both MHC and peptide in an interaction characterized by weak affinity (KD = 100 nm to 270 μm). We used phage-display to produce a melanoma-specific TCR (α24β17) with a 30,000-fold enhanced binding affinity (KD = 0.6 nm) to aid our exploration of the molecular mechanisms utilized to maintain peptide specificity. Remarkably, although the enhanced affinity was mediated primarily through new TCR-MHC contacts, α24β17 remained acutely sensitive to modifications at every position along the peptide backbone, mimicking the specificity of the wild type TCR. Thermodynamic analyses revealed an important role for solvation in directing peptide specificity. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that can govern the exquisite peptide specificity characteristic of TCR recognition.},

Previous studies focused on a single deep learning model. In this paper we design an ensemble algorithm combining a set of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for GW signal recognition. The whole ensemble model consists of two sub-ensemble models. Each sub-ensemble model is also an ensemble model of deep learning. The two sub-ensemble models treat data of Hanford and Livinston detectors respectively. Proper voting scheme is adopted to combine the two sub-ensemble models to form the whole ensemble model. We apply this ensemble model to all reported GW events in the first observation and second observation runs (O1/O2) by LIGO-VIRGO Scientific Collaboration. We find that the ensemble algorithm can clearly identify all binary black hole merger events except GW170818. We also apply the ensemble model to one month (August 2017) data of O2. There is no false trigger happens although only O1 data are used for training. Our test results indicate that the ensemble learning algorithms can be used in real-time GW data analysis.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of gravitational wave searches is reduced by the presence of non-Gaussian noise in the detector data. These non-Gaussianities often match well with the template waveforms used in matched filter searches, and require signal-consistency tests to distinguish them from astrophysical signals. However, empirically tuning these tests for maximum efficacy is time consuming and limits the complexity of these tests. In this work we demonstrate a framework to use machine-learning techniques to automatically tune signal-consistency tests. We implement a new \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ signal-consistency test targeting the large population of noise found in searches for intermediate mass black hole binaries, training the new test using the framework set out in this paper. We find that this method effectively trains a complex model to down-weight the noise, while leaving the signal population relatively unaffected. This improves the sensitivity of the search by \$\textbackslash sim 11\textbackslash\%\$ for signals with masses \${$>$} 300 M\_\textbackslash odot\$. In the future this framework could be used to implement new tests in any of the commonly used matched-filter search algorithms, further improving the sensitivity of our searches.},

By structuring these data objects and interactions between these objects into multiple types, such networks become semi-structured heterogeneous information networks. Most real-world applications that handle big data, including interconnected social media and social networks, scientific, engineering, or medical information systems, online e-commerce systems, and most database systems, can be structured into heterogeneous information networks. Therefore, effective analysis of large-scale heterogeneous information networks poses an interesting but critical challenge. In this book, we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining heterogeneous information networks. Departing from many existing network models that view interconnected data as homogeneous graphs or networks, our semi-structured heterogeneous information network model leverages the rich semantics of typed nodes and links in a network and uncovers surprisingly rich knowledge from the network. This semi-structured heterogeneous network modeling leads to a series of new principles and powerful methodologies for mining interconnected data, including: (1) rank-based clustering and classification; (2) meta-path-based similarity search and mining; (3) relation strength-aware mining, and many other potential developments. This book introduces this new research frontier and points out some promising research directions.

This challenge is primarily due to three dominant factors: data accuracy, data scarceness, and problem complexity. Here, we showcase that “shallow” convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are adequate to deal with the problem complexity imposed by the length variations of TCRs. We demonstrate that current public bulk CDR3β-pMHC binding data overall is of low quality and that the development of accurate prediction models is contingent on paired α/β TCR sequence data corresponding to at least 150 distinct pairs for each investigated pMHC. In comparison, models trained on CDR3α or CDR3β data alone demonstrated a variable and pMHC specific relative performance drop. Together these findings support that T-cell specificity is predictable given the availability of accurate and sufficient paired TCR sequence data.

While conventional analyses parametrize this population with simple phenomenological models, we propose an innovative physics-first approach that compares gravitational-wave data against astrophysical simulations. We combine state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques with hierarchical Bayesian inference and exploit our approach to constrain the properties of repeated black-hole mergers from the gravitational-wave events in the most recent LIGO/Virgo catalog. Deep neural networks allow us to (i) construct a flexible population model that accurately emulates simulations of hierarchical mergers, (ii) estimate selection effects, and (iii) recover the branching ratios of repeated-merger generations. Among our results we find that: the distribution of host-environment escape speeds favors values {$<$}100 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ but is relatively flat; first-generation black holes are born with a maximum mass that is compatible with current estimates from pair-instability supernovae; there is multimodal substructure in both the mass and spin distributions due to repeated mergers; and binaries with a higher-generation component make up at least 15\% of the underlying population. The deep-learning pipeline we present is ready to be used in conjunction with realistic astrophysical population-synthesis predictions.},

  abstract = {BackgroundBinding of peptides to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules is the single most selective step in the recognition of pathogens by the cellular immune system. The human MHC class I system (HLA-I) is extremely polymorphic. The number of registered HLA-I molecules has now surpassed 1500. Characterizing the specificity of each separately would be a major undertaking.Principal FindingsHere, we have drawn on a large database of known peptide-HLA-I interactions to develop a bioinformatics method, which takes both peptide and HLA sequence information into account, and generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-HLA-I interaction. Prospective experimental validation of peptides predicted to bind to previously untested HLA-I molecules, cross-validation, and retrospective prediction of known HIV immune epitopes and endogenous presented peptides, all successfully validate this method. We further demonstrate that the method can be applied to perform a clustering analysis of MHC specificities and suggest using this clustering to select particularly informative novel MHC molecules for future biochemical and functional analysis.ConclusionsEncompassing all HLA molecules, this high-throughput computational method lends itself to epitope searches that are not only genome- and pathogen-wide, but also HLA-wide. Thus, it offers a truly global analysis of immune responses supporting rational development of vaccines and immunotherapy. It also promises to provide new basic insights into HLA structure-function relationships. The method is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan.},

In this paper, we design an event meta-schema to characterize the semantic relatedness of social events and build an event-based heterogeneous information network (HIN) integrating information from external knowledge base, and propose a novel Pairwise Popularity Graph Convolutional Network (PP-GCN) based fine-grained social event categorization model. We propose a Knowledgeable meta-paths Instances based social Event Similarity (KIES) between events and build a weighted adjacent matrix as input to the PP-GCN model. Comprehensive experiments on real data collections are conducted to compare various social event detection and clustering tasks.

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in transgenic animal models and display technologies, humanization of mouse sequences remains one of the main routes for therapeutic antibody development. Traditionally, humanization is manual, laborious, and requires expert knowledge. Although automation efforts are advancing, existing methods are either demonstrated on a small scale or are entirely proprietary. To predict the immunogenicity risk, the human-likeness of sequences can be evaluated using existing humanness scores, but these lack diversity, granularity or interpretability. Meanwhile, immune repertoire sequencing has generated rich antibody libraries such as the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) that offer augmented diversity not yet exploited for antibody engineering. Here we present BioPhi, an open-source platform featuring novel methods for humanization (Sapiens) and humanness evaluation (OASis). Sapiens is a deep learning humanization method trained on the OAS using language modeling. Based on an in silico humanization benchmark of 177 antibodies, Sapiens produced sequences at scale while achieving results comparable to that of human experts. OASis is a granular, interpretable and diverse humanness score based on 9-mer peptide search in the OAS. OASis separated human and non-human sequences with high accuracy, and correlated with clinical immunogenicity. BioPhi thus offers an antibody design interface with automated methods that capture the richness of natural antibody repertoires to produce therapeutics with desired properties and accelerate antibody discovery campaigns. The BioPhi platform is accessible at https://biophi.dichlab.org and https://github.com/Merck/BioPhi.},

  abstract = {Driven by the considerable profits, the crime of drug trafficking (a.k.a. illicit drug trading) has co-evolved with modern technologies, e.g., social media such as Instagram has become a popular platform for marketing and selling illicit drugs. The activities of online drug trafficking are nimble and resilient, which call for novel techniques to effectively detect, disrupt, and dismantle illicit drug trades. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework named MetaHG to automatically detect illicit drug traffickers on social media (i.e., Instagram), by tackling the following two new challenges: (1) different from existing works which merely focus on analyzing post content, MetaHG is capable of jointly modeling multi-modal content and relational structured information on social media for illicit drug trafficker detection; (2) in addition, through the proposed meta-learning technique, MetaHG addresses the issue of requiring sufficient data for model training. More specifically, in our proposed MetaHG, we first build a heterogeneous graph (HG) to comprehensively characterize the complex ecosystem of drug trafficking on social media.  Then, we employ a relation-based graph convolutional neural network to learn node (i.e., user) representations over the built HG, in which we introduce graph structure refinement to compensate the sparse connection among entities in the HG for more robust node representation learning. Afterwards, we propose a meta-learning algorithm for model optimization. A self-supervised module and a knowledge distillation module are further designed to exploit unlabeled data for improving the model. Extensive experiments based on the real-world data collected from Instagram demonstrate that the proposed MetaHG outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {\textbackslash emph\{Over-fitting\} and \textbackslash emph\{over-smoothing\} are two main obstacles of developing deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for node classification. In particular, over-fitting weakens the generalization ability on small dataset, while over-smoothing impedes model training by isolating output representations from the input features with the increase in network depth. This paper proposes DropEdge, a novel and flexible technique to alleviate both issues. At its core, DropEdge randomly removes a certain number of edges from the input graph at each training epoch, acting like a data augmenter and also a message passing reducer. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that DropEdge either reduces the convergence speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss caused by it. More importantly, our DropEdge is a general skill that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, ResGCN, GraphSAGE, and JKNet) for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify that DropEdge consistently improves the performance on a variety of both shallow and deep GCNs. The effect of DropEdge on preventing over-smoothing is empirically visualized and validated as well. Codes are released on\textasciitilde\textbackslash url\{https://github.com/DropEdge/DropEdge\}.},

Low latency time of gravitational wave searches and accurate sky localization are keys in triggering successful follow-up observations on the electromagnetic counterparts. Here we present a deep learning method for the first time to rapidly search for MBHB signals in the strain data. Our model is capable to process 1-year of data in just several seconds, identifying all MBHB coalescences with no false alarms. We test the performance of our model on the simulated data from the LISA data challenge. We demonstrate that the model shows a robust resistance for a wide range of generalization for MBHB signals. This method is supposed to be an effective approach, which combined the advances of artificial intelligence to open a new pathway for space-based gravitational wave observations.},

We produced visualizations of the response of machine learning models when they process advanced LIGO data that contains real gravitational wave signals, noise anomalies, and pure advanced LIGO noise. Our findings shed light on the responses of individual neurons in these machine learning models. Further analysis suggests that different parts of the network appear to specialize in local versus global features, and that this difference appears to be rooted in the branched architecture of the network as well as noise characteristics of the LIGO detectors. We believe efforts to whiten these "black box" models can suggest future avenues for research and help inform the design of interpretable machine learning models for gravitational wave astrophysics.},

The Grand-designs exhibit almost continuous, high contrast spiral arms and are believed to be driven by density waves; the Flocculents, on the other hand, have patchy or discontinuous spiral features and are mostly stochastic in origin. We construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that classifies spirals into Grand-designs and Flocculents, with a testing accuracy of \$\textbackslash mathrm\{97.2\textbackslash\%\}\$. We then use the above model for classifying \$\textbackslash mathrm\{1,220\}\$ new spirals from the SDSS.

The mean asymptotic rotational velocity of our sample Grand-designs and Flocculents are \$\textbackslash mathrm\{218 \textbackslash; km \textbackslash; s\^\{-1\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathrm\{145 \textbackslash; km \textbackslash; s\^\{-1\}\}\$ respectively, while their respective de Vaucouleur morphological type indices are \$\textbackslash mathrm\{2.6\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathrm\{4.7\}\$.

Several of these methods are reminiscent of the well-known word2vec embedding algorithm: leveraging availability of pairs of semantically “similar" data points and “negative samples," the learner forces the inner product of representations of similar pairs with each other to be higher on average than with negative samples. The current paper uses the term contrastive learning for such algorithms and presents a theoretical framework for analyzing them by introducing latent classes and hypothesizing that semantically similar points are sampled from the same latent class. This framework allows us to show provable guarantees on the performance of the learned representations on the average classification task that is comprised of a subset of the same set of latent classes. Our generalization bound also shows that learned representations can reduce (labeled) sample complexity on downstream tasks. We conduct controlled experiments in both the text and image domains to support the theory.},

We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e.~subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to handle the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved through the use of an R-GCN encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8\% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline.},

  abstract = {We apply machine learning methods to build a time-domain model for gravitational waveforms from binary black hole mergers, called mlgw. The dimensionality of the problem is handled by representing the waveform's amplitude and phase using a principal component analysis. We train mlgw on about \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^3)\$ TEOBResumS and SEOBNRv4 effective-one-body waveforms with mass ratios \$q\textbackslash in[1,20]\$ and aligned dimensionless spins \$s\textbackslash in[-0.80,0.95]\$. The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at the \$\{\textbackslash sim\}10\^\{-3\}\$ level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by third-generation detectors. Future applications include the analysis of waveform systematics and model selection in parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {Despite significant recent advances in the field of face recognition [10, 14, 15, 17], implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure offace similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings asfeature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-artface recognition performance using only 128-bytes perface. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63\%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result [15] by 30\% on both datasets.},

However, this combined model is challenged when operating with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data embedded in non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise. To address this issue, we design a novel model, referred to as `Enhanced Deep Recurrent Denoising Auto-Encoder' (EDR-DAE), that incorporates a signal amplifier layer, and applies curriculum learning by first denoising high SNR signals, before gradually decreasing the SNR until the signals become noise dominated. We showcase the performance of EDR-DAE using time-series data that describes gravitational waves embedded in very noisy backgrounds. In addition, we show that EDRDAE can accurately denoise signals whose topology is significantly more complex than those used for training, demonstrating that our model generalizes to new classes of gravitational waves that are beyond the scope of established denoising algorithms.},

ESE is important for many applications such as dictionary construction and query suggestion. Traditional ESE methods relied heavily on the text and Web information of entities. Recently, some ESE methods employed knowledge graphs (KGs) to extend entities. However, they failed to effectively and efficiently utilize the rich semantics contained in a KG and ignored the text information of entities in Wikipedia. In this paper, we model a KG as a heterogeneous information network (HIN) containing multiple types of objects and relations. Fine-grained multi-type meta paths are proposed to capture the hidden relation among seed entities in a KG and thus to retrieve candidate entities. Then we rank the entities according to the meta path based structural similarity. Furthermore, to utilize the text description of entities in Wikipedia, we propose an extended model CoMeSE++ which combines both structural information revealed by a KG and text information in Wikipedia for ESE. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves better performance by combining structural and textual information of entities.},

It is challenging to develop effective methods for HIN based recommendation in both extraction and exploitation of the information from HINs. Most of HIN based recommendation methods rely on path based similarity, which cannot fully mine latent structure features of users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding based approach for HIN based recommendation, called HERec. To embed HINs, we design a meta-path based random walk strategy to generate meaningful node sequences for network embedding. The learned node embeddings are first transformed by a set of fusion functions, and subsequently integrated into an extended matrix factorization (MF) model. The extended MF model together with fusion functions are jointly optimized for the rating prediction task. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HERec model. Moreover, we show the capability of the HERec model for the cold-start problem, and reveal that the transformed embedding information from HINs can improve the recommendation performance.},

  abstract = {Recently heterogeneous information network (HIN) analysis has attracted a lot of attention, and many data mining tasks have been exploited on HIN. As an important data mining task, recommender system includes a lot of object types (e.g., users, movies, actors, and interest groups in movie recommendation) and the rich relations among object types, which naturally constitute a HIN. The comprehensive information integration and rich semantic information of HIN make it promising to generate better recommendations. However, conventional HINs do not consider the attribute values on links, and the widely used meta path in HIN may fail to accurately capture semantic relations among objects, due to the existence of rating scores (usually ranging from 1 to 5) between users and items in recommender system. In this paper, we are the first to propose the weighted HIN and weighted meta path concepts to subtly depict the path semantics through distinguishing different link attribute values. Furthermore, we propose a semantic path based personalized recommendation method SemRec to predict the rating scores of users on items. Through setting meta paths, SemRec not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information but also obtains prioritized and personalized weights representing user preferences on paths. Experiments on two real datasets illustrate that SemRec achieves better recommendation performance through flexibly integrating information with the help of weighted meta paths.},

With the remarkable success from the state of the art convolutional neural networks, recent works have shown promising results on discriminatively training the networks to learn semantic feature embeddings where similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for taking full advantage of the training batches in the neural network training by lifting the vector of pairwise distances within the batch to the matrix of pairwise distances. This step enables the algorithm to learn the state of the art feature embedding by optimizing a novel structured prediction objective on the lifted problem. Additionally, we collected Online Products dataset: 120k images of 23k classes of online products for metric learning. Our experiments on the CUB-200-2011, CARS196, and Online Products datasets demonstrate significant improvement over existing deep feature embedding methods on all experimented embedding sizes with the GoogLeNet network.},

A variety of available check-in data provide a good opportunity for developing personalized POI recommender systems. However, the extreme sparsity of check-in data and inefficiency of exploiting unobserved feedback pose severe challenges for POI recommendation. To cope with these challenges, we develop a heterogeneous graph embedding-based personalized POI recommendation framework called HRec. It consists of two modules: the learning module and the ranking module. Specifically, we first propose the learning module to produce a series of intermediate feedback from unobserved feedback by learning the embeddings of users and POIs in the heterogeneous graph. Then we devise the ranking module to recommend each user the ultimate ranked list of relevant POIs by utilizing two pairwise feedback comparisons. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

However, many metric learning algorithms often require intractable computational cost due to frequent feature computations and nearest neighbor searches in a large-scale dataset. As a result, existing approaches often suffer from trade-off between training speed and prediction accuracy. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a stochastic hard negative mining method. Our key idea is to adopt class signatures that keep track of feature embedding online with minor additional cost during training, and identify hard negative example candidates using the signatures. Given an anchor instance, our algorithm first selects a few hard negative classes based on the class-to-sample distances and then performs a refined search in an instance-level only from the selected classes. As most of the classes are discarded at the first step, it is much more efficient than exhaustive search while effectively mining a large number of hard examples. Our experiment shows that the proposed technique improves image retrieval accuracy substantially; it achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the several standard benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Real-world physical and abstract data objects are interconnected, forming gigantic, interconnected networks. By structuring these data objects and interactions between these objects into multiple types, such networks become semi-structured heterogeneous information networks. Most real-world applications that handle big data, including interconnected social media and social networks, scientific, engineering, or medical information systems, online e-commerce systems, and most database systems, can be structured into heterogeneous information networks. Therefore, effective analysis of large-scale heterogeneous information networks poses an interesting but critical challenge. In this book, we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining heterogeneous information networks. Departing from many existing network models that view interconnected data as homogeneous graphs or networks, our semi-structured heterogeneous information network model leverages the rich semantics of typed nodes and links in a network and uncovers surprisingly rich knowledge from the network. This semi-structured heterogeneous network modeling leads to a series of new principles and powerful methodologies for mining interconnected data, including: (1) rank-based clustering and classification; (2) meta-path-based similarity search and mining; (3) relation strength-aware mining, and many other potential developments. This book introduces this new research frontier and points out some promising research directions.

  abstract = {Similarity search is a primitive operation in database and Web search engines. With the advent of large-scale heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-typed, interconnected objects, such as the bibliographic networks and social media networks, it is important to study similarity search in such networks. Intuitively, two objects are similar if they are linked by many paths in the network. However, most existing similarity measures are defined for homogeneous networks. Different semantic meanings behind paths are not taken into consideration. Thus they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we study similarity search that is defined among the same type of objects in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage paths in a network, one could derive various similarity semantics. Therefore, we introduce the concept of meta path-based similarity, where a meta path is a path consisting of a sequence of relations defined between different object types (i.e., structural paths at the meta level). No matter whether a user would like to explicitly specify a path combination given sufficient domain knowledge, or choose the best path by experimental trials, or simply provide training examples to learn it, meta path forms a common base for a network-based similarity search engine. In particular, under the meta path framework we define a novel similarity measure called PathSim that is able to find peer objects in the network (e.g., find authors in the similar field and with similar reputation), which turns out to be more meaningful in many scenarios compared with random-walk based similarity measures. In order to support fast online query processing for PathSim queries, we develop an efficient solution that partially materializes short meta paths and then concatenates them online to compute top-k results. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed paradigm.},

  abstract = {We consider the flare prediction problem that distinguishes flare-imminent active regions that produce an M- or X-class flare in the future 24 hours, from quiet active regions that do not produce any flare within \$\textbackslash pm 24\$ hours. Using line-of-sight magnetograms and parameters of active regions in two data products covering Solar Cycle 23 and 24, we train and evaluate two deep learning algorithms -- CNN and LSTM -- and their stacking ensembles. The decisions of CNN are explained using visual attribution methods. We have the following three main findings. (1) LSTM trained on data from two solar cycles achieves significantly higher True Skill Scores (TSS) than that trained on data from a single solar cycle with a confidence level of at least 0.95. (2) On data from Solar Cycle 23, a stacking ensemble that combines predictions from LSTM and CNN using the TSS criterion achieves significantly higher TSS than the "select-best" strategy with a confidence level of at least 0.95. (3) A visual attribution method called Integrated Gradients is able to attribute the CNN's predictions of flares to the emerging magnetic flux in the active region. It also reveals a limitation of CNN as a flare prediction method using line-of-sight magnetograms: it treats the polarity artifact of line-of-sight magnetograms as positive evidence of flares.},

As an alternative, a manually-curated database can relate TCR sequences with their cognate antigens and associated pathologies based on published experimental data.We present McPAS-TCR, a manually curated database of TCR sequences associated with various pathologies and antigens based on published literature. Our database currently contains more than 5000 sequences of TCRs associated with various pathologic conditions (including pathogen infections, cancer and autoimmunity) and their respective antigens in humans and in mice. A web-based tool allows for searching the database based on different criteria, and for finding annotated sequences from the database in users’ data. The McPAS-TCR website assembles information from a large number of studies that is very hard to dissect otherwise. Initial analyses of the data provide interesting insights on pathology-associated TCR sequences.Free access at http://friedmanlab.weizmann.ac.il/McPAS-TCR/.},

There were no immunogenic epitopes shared between these patients. However, we identified in one patient a human leukocyte antigen-C*08:02-restricted T cell receptor from CD8(+) TILs that targeted the KRAS(G12D) hotspot driver mutation found in many human cancers.

Existing methods mainly focus on static networks, while a real HIN usually evolves over time with the addition (deletion) of multiple types of nodes and edges. Because even a tiny change can influence the whole structure and semantics, the conventional HIN embedding methods need to be retrained to get the updated embeddings, which is time-consuming and unrealistic. In this paper, we investigate the problem of dynamic HIN embedding and propose a novel Dynamic HIN Embedding model (DyHNE) with meta-path based proximity. Specifically, we introduce the meta-path based first- and second-order proximities to preserve structure and semantics in HINs. As the HIN evolves over time, we naturally capture changes with the perturbation of meta-path augmented adjacency matrices. Thereafter, we learn the node embeddings by solving generalized eigenvalue problem effectively and employ eigenvalue perturbation to derive the updated embeddings efficiently without retraining. Experiments show that DyHNE outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.},

In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the recent development on HG embedding methods and techniques.

In particular, for each representative HG embedding method, we provide detailed introduction and further analyze its pros and cons; meanwhile, we explore the transformativeness and applicability of different types of HG embedding methods in the real-world industrial environments. We further present several widely deployed systems that have demonstrated the success of HG embedding techniques in resolving real-world application problems. To facilitate future research and applications in this area, we also summarize the open-source code, existing graph learning platforms and benchmark datasets.

Using hand-crafted features often fails to capture the complex dynamics in human social relations, while the graph embedding based methods only use random walks to propagate information and cannot incorporate external semantic data provided. We propose a novel model that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn user embeddings on the User Mobility Heterogeneous Graph in an unsupervised manner. This model is capable of propagating relation layer-wisely as well as combining both the rich structural information in the heterogeneous graph and predictive node features provided. Our method can also be extended to a semi-supervised setting if a part of the social network is available.

While promising, prior works in the field often fail to properly capture complex relation information that commonly exists in multi-relational KGs, leaving much room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Dual-Graph Convolutional Network (RDGCN) to incorporate relation information via attentive interactions between the knowledge graph and its dual relation counterpart, and further capture neighboring structures to learn better entity representations.

We propose distance weighted sampling, which selects more informative and stable examples than traditional approaches. In addition, we show that a simple margin based loss is sufficient to outperform all other loss functions. We evaluate our approach on the Stanford Online Products, CAR196, and the CUB200-2011 datasets for image retrieval and clustering, and on the LFW dataset for face verification.

In addition, in order to learn user interest embedding from the personalized heterogeneous graph, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph pooling method, which can summarize both node features and graph topology, and be aware of the varied characteristics of different types of nodes.

  abstract = {In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) and other deep learning models have been gradually introduced into the area of gravitational-wave (GW) data processing. Compared with the traditional matched-filtering techniques, CNN has significant advantages in efficiency in GW signal detection tasks. In addition, matched-filtering techniques are based on the template bank of the existing theoretical waveform, which makes it difficult to find GW signals beyond theoretical expectation. In this paper, based on the task of GW detection of binary black holes, we introduce the optimization techniques of deep learning, such as batch normalization and dropout, to CNN models. Detailed studies of model performance are carried out. Through this study, we recommend to use batch normalization and dropout techniques in CNN models in GW signal detection tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the generalization ability of CNN models on different parameter ranges of GW signals. We point out that CNN models are robust to the variation of the parameter range of the GW waveform. This is a major advantage of deep learning models over matched-filtering techniques.},

In particular, accurate prediction can make runtime estimates more precise, guide users toward optimal checkpoint strategies, and better inform facility provisioning and scheduling policies. HPC I/O performance is notoriously difficult to predict and model, however, in large part because of inherent variability and a lack of transparency in the behaviors of constituent storage system components. In this work we seek to advance the state of the art in HPC I/O performance prediction by (1) modeling the mean performance to address high variability, (2) deriving model features from write patterns, system architecture and system configurations, and (3) employing Lasso regression model to improve model accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to a crucial subset of common HPC I/O motifs, namely, file-per-process checkpoint write workloads. We conduct experiments on two distinct production HPC platforms - Titan at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility and Cetus at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility - to train and evaluate our models. We find that we can attain ≤ 30\% relative error for 92.79\% and 99.64\% of the samples in our test set on these platforms, respectively.},

  abstract = {Triplet loss is an extremely common approach to distance metric learning. Representations of images from the same class are optimized to be mapped closer together in an embedding space than representations of images from different classes. Much work on triplet losses focuses on selecting the most useful triplets of images to consider, with strategies that select dissimilar examples from the same class or similar examples from different classes. The consensus of previous research is that optimizing with the hardest negative examples leads to bad training behavior. That’s a problem – these hardest negatives are literally the cases where the distance metric fails to capture semantic similarity. In this paper, we characterize the space of triplets and derive why hard negatives make triplet loss training fail. We offer a simple fix to the loss function and show that, with this fix, optimizing with hard negative examples becomes feasible. This leads to more generalizable features, and image retrieval results that outperform state of the art for datasets with high intra-class variance.

It has achieved great success on many tasks of network analysis such as link prediction and node classification. Most of existing network embedding algorithms focus on how to learn static homogeneous networks effectively. However, networks in the real world are more complex, e.g.., networks may consist of several types of nodes and edges (called heterogeneous information) and may vary over time in terms of dynamic nodes and edges (called evolutionary patterns). Limited work has been done for network embedding of dynamic heterogeneous networks as it is challenging to learn both evolutionary and heterogeneous information simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic heterogeneous network embedding method, termed as DyHATR, which uses hierarchical attention to learn heterogeneous information and incorporates recurrent neural networks with temporal attention to capture evolutionary patterns. We benchmark our method on four real-world datasets for the task of link prediction. Experimental results show that DyHATR significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Recently, network embedding has been successfully used in recommendation systems. Researchers have made efforts to utilize additional auxiliary information (e.g., social relations of users) to improve performance. However, such auxiliary information lacks compatibility for all recommendation scenarios, thus it is difficult to apply in some industrial scenarios where generality is required. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature between users and items aggravates the difficulty in network information fusion. Many works tried to transform user-item heterogeneous network to two homogeneous graphs (i.e., user-user and item-item), and then fuse information separately. This may limit the representation power of learned embedding due to ignoring the adjacent relationship in the original graph. In addition, the sparsity of user-item interactions is an urgent problem need to be solved. To solve the above problems, we propose a universal and effective framework named Gemini, which only relies on the common interaction logs, avoiding the dependence on auxiliary information and ensuring a better generality. For the purpose of keeping original adjacent relationship, Gemini transforms the original user-item heterogeneous graph into two semi homogeneous graphs from the perspective of users and items respectively. The transformed graphs consist of two types of nodes: network nodes coming from homogeneous nodes and attribute nodes coming from heterogeneous node. Then, the node representation is learned in a homogeneous way, with considering edge embedding at the same time. Simultaneously, the interaction sparsity problem is solved to some extent as the transformed graphs contain the original second-order neighbors. For training efficiently, we also propose an iterative training algorithm to reduce computational complexity. Experimental results on the five datasets and online A/B tests in recommendations of DiDiChuXing show that Gemini outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is among the most successful techniques in recommendation tasks. Recent works have shown a boost of performance of CF when introducing the pairwise relationships between users and items or among items (users) using interaction data. However, these works usually only utilize one kind of information, i.e., user preference in a user-item interaction matrix or item dependency in interaction sequences which can limit the recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose to mine three kinds of information (user preference, item dependency, and user similarity on behaviors) by converting interaction sequence data into multiple graphs (i.e., a user-item graph, an item-item graph, and a user-subseq graph). We design a novel graph convolutional network (PGCN) to learn shared representations of users and items with the three heterogeneous graphs. In our approach, a neighbor pooling and a convolution operation are designed to aggregate features of neighbors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our graph convolution approaches outperform various competitive methods in terms of two metrics, and the heterogeneous graphs are proved effective for improving recommendation performance.},

We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of "neighboring" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance.},

  abstract = {Most attempts on extending Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) implicitly take the direct assumption that the multiple homogeneous attributed networks induced by different meta-paths are complementary. The doubts about the hypothesis of complementary motivate an alternative assumption of consensus. That is, the aggregated node attributes shared by multiple homogeneous attributed networks are essential for node representations, while the specific ones in each homogeneous attributed network should be discarded. In this paper, a novel Heterogeneous Graph Information Bottleneck (HGIB) is proposed to implement the consensus hypothesis in an unsupervised manner. To this end, information bottleneck (IB) is extended to unsupervised representation learning by leveraging self-supervision strategy. Specifically, HGIB simultaneously maximizes the mutual information between one homogeneous network and the representation learned from another homogeneous network, while minimizes the mutual information between the specific information contained in one homogeneous network and the representation learned from this homogeneous network. Model analysis reveals that the two extreme cases of HGIB correspond to the supervised heterogeneous GNN and the infomax on homogeneous graph, respectively. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the consensus-based unsupervised HGIB significantly outperforms most semi-supervised SOTA methods based on complementary assumption.},

  abstract = {Visual commonsense reasoning task aims at leading the research field into solving cognition-level reasoning with the ability to predict correct answers and meanwhile providing convincing reasoning paths, resulting in three sub-tasks i.e., Q-{$>$}A, QA-{$>$}R and Q-{$>$}AR. It poses great challenges over the proper semantic alignment between vision and linguistic domains and knowledge reasoning to generate persuasive reasoning paths. Existing works either resort to a powerful end-to-end network that cannot produce interpretable reasoning paths or solely explore intra-relationship of visual objects (homogeneous graph) while ignoring the cross-domain semantic alignment among visual concepts and linguistic words. In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) framework for seamlessly integrating the intra-graph and inter-graph reasoning in order to bridge the vision and language domain. Our HGL consists of a primal vision-to-answer heterogeneous graph (VAHG) module and a dual question-to-answer heterogeneous graph (QAHG) module to interactively refine reasoning paths for semantic agreement. Moreover, our HGL integrates a contextual voting module to exploit a long-range visual context for better global reasoning. Experiments on the large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed modules on three tasks (improving 5\% accuracy on Q-{$>$}A, 3.5\% on QA-{$>$}R, 5.8\% on Q-{$>$}AR).},

  abstract = {Representation learning in heterogeneous graphs aims to pursue a meaningful vector representation for each node so as to facilitate downstream applications such as link prediction, personalized recommendation, node classification, etc. This task, however, is challenging not only because of the demand to incorporate heterogeneous structural (graph) information consisting of multiple types of nodes and edges, but also due to the need for considering heterogeneous attributes or contents (e.g., text or image) associated with each node. Despite a substantial amount of effort has been made to homogeneous (or heterogeneous) graph embedding, attributed graph embedding as well as graph neural networks, few of them can jointly consider heterogeneous structural (graph) information as well as heterogeneous contents information of each node effectively. In this paper, we propose HetGNN, a heterogeneous graph neural network model, to resolve this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a random walk with restart strategy to sample a fixed size of strongly correlated heterogeneous neighbors for each node and group them based upon node types. Next, we design a neural network architecture with two modules to aggregate feature information of those sampled neighboring nodes. The first module encodes "deep" feature interactions of heterogeneous contents and generates content embedding for each node. The second module aggregates content (attribute) embeddings of different neighboring groups (types) and further combines them by considering the impacts of different groups to obtain the ultimate node embedding. Finally, we leverage a graph context loss and a mini-batch gradient descent procedure to train the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that HetGNN can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in various graph mining tasks, i.e., link prediction, recommendation, node classification \& clustering and inductive node classification \& clustering.},

However, the unknown functional relevance of TCR profiling hinders unbiased interpretation of the biology of T cells. To address this inadequacy, we developed tessa, a tool to integrate TCRs with gene expression of T cells to estimate the effect that TCRs confer on the phenotypes of T cells. Tessa leveraged techniques combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with TCR sequencing. We validated tessa and showed its superiority over existing approaches that investigate only the TCR sequences. With tessa, we demonstrated that TCR similarity constrains the phenotypes of T cells to be similar and dictates a gradient in antigen targeting efficiency of T cell clonotypes with convergent TCRs. We showed this constraint could predict a functional dichotomization of T cells postimmunotherapy treatment and is weakened in tumor contexts.},

Understanding these receptors is critical for exploring the process of immunoreaction and exploiting potential applications in immunotherapy and antibody drug design. Although a large number of samples have had their TCR and BCR repertoires sequenced using high-throughput sequencing in recent years, very few databases have been constructed to store these kinds of data. To resolve this issue, we developed a database. RESULTS: We developed a database, the Pan Immune Repertoire Database (PIRD), located in China National GeneBank (CNGBdb), to collect and store annotated TCR and BCR sequencing data, including from Homo sapiens and other species. In addition to data storage, PIRD also provides functions of data visualization and interactive online analysis. Additionally, a manually curated database of TCRs and BCRs targeting known antigens (TBAdb) was also deposited in PIRD. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PIRD can be freely accessed at https://db.cngb.org/pird.},

However, most studies have focused on a single typed external relationship and not fully utilized the latent relationships among users and items. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous network embedding-based recommendation method called HetNERec. Specifically, we first construct the co-occurrence networks by extracting multiple co-occurrence relationships from a recommendation-oriented heterogeneous network. We then propose an integration function to integrate multiple network embedded representations into a single representation to enhance the recommendation performance. Finally, the matrix factorization is extended by integrating the embedded representations and considering the latent relationships among users and items. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed HetNERec outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

  abstract = {The remarkable progress of network embedding has led to state-of-the-art algorithms in recommendation. However, the sparsity of user-item interactions (i.e., explicit preferences) on websites remains a big challenge for predicting users' behaviors. Although research efforts have been made in utilizing some auxiliary information (e.g., social relations between users) to solve the problem, the existing rich heterogeneous auxiliary relationships are still not fully exploited. Moreover, previous works relied on linearly combined regularizers and suffered parameter tuning. In this work, we collect abundant relationships from common user behaviors and item information, and propose a novel framework named IntentGC to leverage both explicit preferences and heterogeneous relationships by graph convolutional networks. In addition to the capability of modeling heterogeneity, IntentGC can learn the importance of different relationships automatically by the neural model in a nonlinear sense. To apply IntentGC to web-scale applications, we design a faster graph convolutional model named IntentNet by avoiding unnecessary feature interactions. Empirical experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets and online A/B tests in Alibaba demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms.
