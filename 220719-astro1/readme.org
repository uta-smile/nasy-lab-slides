* Introduction

** Astronomy

A branch of science that covers the study and analysis of all extraterrestrial objects and their phenomena.

+ Origin
+ Evolution
+ Functions

** Astronomy -- Method History

+ Observational astronomy (OA)
  - Human eyes
  - Telescopes
  - Radio
  - Micrometer (e.g. double stars)
  - Spectrograph (e.g. redshift)
  - Photoelectric photometry using Charge-coupled Device (CCD), which
    can record the image nearly down to the level of individual
    photons.
  - Neutrino astronomy
  - Gravitational wave
+ Virtual observatory (VO)

** Astronomy -- Fields

Astronomy is divided into many subfields, such as galactic astronomy,
planetary science, extragalactic astronomy, stellar astronomy, solar
astronomy, and cosmology.  In general, the theoretical and the
observational.

The purpose of observational study is to observe, record, and collect
the data about the universe under study and theoretical scientists
mainly calculate the measurable consequences of physical models.

Theoretical astronomers use the collected data to generate the
simulation model, and the corresponding observations serve the purpose
of evaluating the model or indicating the need for tweaking them.

** Astronomy -- Data

With ultra-modern technology, the astronomical data collection has
been very simple, and rate is very high.  And in astronomy, there are
"4Vs" -- volume, variety, velocity, and value.

+ Volume :: data size -- can be PB, EB, ZB.
+ Variety :: complex elements  -- signals, images, videos, spectra,
  time series, and simulations.
+ Velocity :: rate of production and transmission -- sizeable synoptic
  survey telescopes (LSST) 20 TB per night for ten years.
+ Value :: high value to the astronomy of the data.

** Data -- Data type

+ One-dimensional information in the form of signals;
+ Two-dimensional information in images;
  - multispectral (8-10) and hyperspectral (100+).
  - From electromagnetic (EM) emissions
  - Image data
  - Spectral data
+ Three-dimensional information in the video?;
+ Time series (GW).

+ Electromagnetic Spectrum :: From $1$ Hz to $10^{25}$ Hz,  From km to
  atom size.

** Tasks

+ Stellar Classification [cite:@jing-minNewStellarSpectral2020;@chiuSearchingYoungStellar2021]
  - Most potential applications
  - O, B, A, F, G, K, and M.  (O and M represent the hottest and coolest types)
+ Pulsar Detection and Recognition (Time series, intensity and time)
+ Star / galaxy separation/classification and information analysis [cite:@hausenMorpheusDeepLearning2020]
  - Shape and size
+ Transient Analysis (暂现源, Fast ratio burst (FRB), gamma-ray burst,
  pulsar, gravitational
  wave[cite:@zhangDetectingGravitationalWaves2022], and other
  transient phenomena)(FAST)
+ Astronomical survey analysis (e.g. Gaia survey, Active Galactic Nuclei(AGN))
+ Other applications

* Papers

** Paper 1

+ Detecting gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI)
  using convolutional neural networks
  [cite:@zhangDetectingGravitationalWaves2022]
+ By: Xue-Ting Zhang, Chris Messenger, Natalia Korsakova, Man Leong
  Chan, Yi-Ming Hu, and Jing-dong Zhang

** Gravitational waves

+ Double White Dwarfs (DWDs)
+ Massive Binary Black Holes (MBBHs)
+ Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes (sBBHs)
+ Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs)
+ Stochastic gravitational-wave background (mHz frequency band)

** Waveform models of EMRIs

+ Teukolsky-based waveform and Numerical Kludge (NK) waveform.
+ Analytic Kludge (AK) model, through post-Newtonian equations (max
  4.5 now)
+ Augmented Analytic Kludge (AAK). Accuracy similar to NK with the
  generating speed of AK

** The TianQin (天琴) mission

Ground noise affects accuracy, and TianQin is in space and can
accurately detect gravitational waves.

** Data

Two categories.  One can express the data $d$ as the addition of
random Gaussian noise $n$ and the GW signal $h$.

+ $d(t) = h(t) + n(t)$, if signal is present
+ $d(t) = n(t)$, if there is no signal.

#+caption: An example of whitened data in channel I in comparison with signal hI alone. For this event, the SNR is set to be 50. We draw the reader’s attention to the difference in scale for the noise and the signal. From \cite{zhangDetectingGravitationalWaves2022}

** Model

+ Input :: Simulation data for TianQin, using AK and AKK.

** Experiment and Results

$M$ is MBH mass, \(10^4, 10^7\);  $\rho$ is Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR); $z$ is redshift.

** Experiment and Results

#+attr_latex: :height 5cm
#+caption: The ROC curve of the signals from testing groups 1-3 is shown with the blue, purple, and red lines, respectively. The blue line indicates the expected effectiveness for group 1, the parameters have identical distribution to the training data; for group 2, the distribution is drawn from an astrophysical model; for group 3, the distribution is the same as group 1 and the training data, but switched to the AAK waveform model. The 1-$\sigma$ confidence intervals are indicated by the shaded regions.

The 1-σ confidence intervals are indicated by the shaded regions. The 1-$\sigma$ confidence intervals are indicated by the shaded regions.

Panel (c) shows a single block from the architecture, parameterized by the number P (black) of block operations and the number Q (purple) of convolutional artificial neurons. Panel (b) shows an example zoom-in where there are P=2 groups of Q=4 block operations. Panel (a) shows a zoom-in on a block operation, which consists of batch normalization, Q = 4 CANs, and a rectified linear unit (ReLU).
